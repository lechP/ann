This is pet project intended to play with neural networks.

Below are described current plans to develop it.

**TODO**

Story #2: As an NN_ADEPT I want to learn about book's codebase.
Tasks:
1. The NeuralLayer class (01:09 mins)
2. The ActivationFunction interface (01:09 mins)
3. The neural network class (02:18 mins)
4. Manage to run that shit
5. Time to play! (01:09 mins)
6. Summary (01:09 mins)


**BACKLOG**

Story #3. As an APP_USER I want to set input and see the output value for neuron (use identity activation function for now)
